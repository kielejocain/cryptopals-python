# Cryptopals Solutions in Python 3

My attempt at a full set of tested solutions to the Cryptopals challenges.

To test the library code, run `nosetests` from the root of the project.

To verify the the challenges in a set (e.g. set 1) have been solved, simply run

    python cryptopals/set1.py

and verify that no errors are raised.
